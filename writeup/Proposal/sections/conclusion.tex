New trends in constructing datacenters drive disaggregation of
hardware resources, resulting in fine-grained resource elasticity.
We propose that operating systems running in such datacenter should
be continuously reconfigurable or \emph{fluid}. Such an OS can dynamically
allocate and de-allocate hardware resources based on demand.
% This design supports high resource elasticity and a new angle for viewing the
% hardware resources.
The design leads to new research opportunities
on reconfiguration mechanisms and policies, as well as the design of
new OS abstractions that allow applications to leverage the disaggregate
architecture.
To evaluate these concepts, we are currently prototyping
a hypervisor, a fluid OS, and a prediction model.
